# Coming Soon! Stay Tuned! Our first episode launches on April 15th!

Welcome to Southern Mediation, a podcast series to help you relax, sleep or focus deeply. While we aren't medical doctors, and make no medical claims,   we understand that taking time for yourself will help you be healthier and happier. We listened to many sleep podcasts, which in essence were fine, but here in the South we don't much cotton to having folks stacking our Chakras or lining up our Qi. So we created this series with a dash of southern charm and stories that will bring you home, wherever in the world that may be.
